		\item 
			Consider an infinitely long, hollow cylindrical wire. The wire has outer diameter $b$ and the cylindrical hole at its center has diameter $a$.
			\begin{enumerate}[a)]
				\item 
					Find the magnetic field everywhere if a known current $i$ flows from left to right and the current is uniformly spread over the region between $a$ and $b$.\\
				\item
					Find the force that this wire would exert on a thin, straight length of wire $W$ located a distance $2b$ from the axis of the cylinder if that thin wire had a current $3i$ flowing from left to right.\\
